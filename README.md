The University of Arizona Global Campus app merges several different activities for the user into one application. The app is designed to be used on a Smartphone or Tablet to read and respond to discussions, access your enrolled course material, access grades and assignments, receive instructor guidance, and track degree progress. A new accessibility feature disseminates information via multiple sensory channels, including sound and sight. Students can easily track their degree programs and currently enrolled courses using the interface. A calendar with to-do tasks was also included in the application to help students keep track of important course deadlines. There is also a gateway to Microsoft Office applications such as email, Word, PowerPoint, and other office applications. Finally, students have quick access to designated groups, private communications, recent history, and the ability to request assistance.
